<div align="left">

To launch the project, simply :
  - Use the command `make` which is configured in the `Makefile` to start the Docker containers.
  - Access the Django application at `http://localhost`.

## Project Structure üìÇ

The project is structured as follows:

- `nginx/`: Contains the configuration files for the Nginx server which acts as a reverse proxy to our Django application.
- `transcendance/`: The main Django project directory.
  - `static/`: This directory holds all the static files for the project like CSS, JavaScript, and image files.
  - `templates/`: Contains the HTML template files. These are the front-end files that will be rendered and sent to the client's browser.
  - `tools/`: Includes various utility scripts and tools for the project.
  - `__init__.py`: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.
  - `asgi.py`: Entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.
  - `settings.py`: Contains all the configuration for your Django project.
  - `urls.py`: The URL declarations for this Django project; a ‚Äútable of contents‚Äù of your Django-powered site.
  - `views.py`: Contains the functions and classes that handle what data is displayed in each HTML template.
  - `wsgi.py`: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.
- `.env`: A file to keep all environment variables for the project. This includes secret keys and database configuration.
- `docker-compose.yml`: A YAML file defining services, networks, and volumes for a Docker application.
- `Dockerfile`: A text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image for Docker.
- `Makefile`: A simple way to manage the build process, in our case, a collection of shortcuts to manage Docker containers.
- `manage.py`: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways.
- `README.md`: A markdown file containing information about the project setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
